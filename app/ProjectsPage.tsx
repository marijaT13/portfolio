                        As my bachelor's thesis, I aimed to showcase my existing skills, 
                        acquire new ones, and challenge myself to create a fully functional, 
                        visually appealing website within a limited timeframe.<br/>

                        In my final year, I decided to create an Android app developed 
                        entirely in Java â€” a travel guide showcasing the beauty of Macedonia.<br/>
                        Although it was my first app, the project was a success: simple, functional,
                        and an excellent foundation for learning mobile development. <br/>
                        With this project, I:
                        <li>Gained hands-on experience with Java for Android development, 
                          including UI design and app lifecycle management,</li>
                        <li>
                          implemented core app features, such as interactive maps, 
                          informational content, and user navigation and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          learned how to structure a project effectively, laying the 
                          groundwork for more complex apps in the future.

                        This project was a basic front-end project using HTML and CSS, 
                        completed in collaboration with a partner.<br/>
                        Our goal was to test our abilities, learn effective communication,
                        work on a single code branch, create a cohesive design, and implement interactive widgets.<br/>
                        Although simple, it was our first project during our early days of college, and it laid the
                        foundation for future teamwork and development skills.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Through this project, I: 
                        <li>Learned how to collaborate effectively on a shared codebase, managing conflicts 
                          and coordinating tasks,</li>
                        <li>
                          practiced creating cohesive designs that integrate multiple elements seamlessly and 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                         gained experience implementing interactive front-end components, such as widgets and 
                         dynamic content.

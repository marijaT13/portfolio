                        In my final year, I decided to create an Android app developed 
                        entirely in Java â€” a travel guide showcasing the beauty of Macedonia.<br/>
                        Although it was my first app, the project was a success: simple, functional,
                        and an excellent foundation for learning mobile development. <br/>
                        With this project, I: </p>
                        <li>Gained hands-on experience with Java for Android development, 
                          including UI design and app lifecycle management,</li>
                        <li>
                          implemented core app features, such as interactive maps, 
                          informational content, and user navigation and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          learned how to structure a project effectively, laying the 
                          groundwork for more complex apps in the future.

                        This project was a basic front-end project using HTML and CSS, 
                        completed in collaboration with a partner.<br/>
                        Our goal was to test our abilities, learn effective communication,
                        work on a single code branch, create a cohesive design, and implement interactive widgets.<br/>
                        Although simple, it was our first project during our early days of college, and it laid the
                        foundation for future teamwork and development skills.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Through this project, I:    </p>

                        <li>
                          practiced creating cohesive designs that integrate multiple elements seamlessly and

                        <li>
                         gained experience implementing interactive front-end components, such as widgets and 
                         dynamic content.

                        These projects are primarily experimental. With them, 
                        I aimed to deepen my understanding of React, Vite, and TypeScript.<br/>
                        I found that the best way to learn was by building small, practical 
                        widgets and mini-projects with easy implementation.<br/>
                        Through these projects, I was able to: </p>
                       
                        <li>Develop reusable React components and understand component 
                          lifecycle management,</li>
                        <li>
                          apply TypeScript for type safety and maintainable code and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                         integrate simple tools and libraries to enhance functionality 
                         and user experience.
